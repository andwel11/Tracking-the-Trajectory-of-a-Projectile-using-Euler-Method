# Tracking-the-Trajectory-of-a-Projectile- with-no-drag-using-Euler-Method
This code will model the trajectory of a hard spherical ball with no drag using Euler method provided the initial position, initial speed and angle of inclination to the horizontal in degrees at an initial time, t0 in steps dt until final time, tf is reached
